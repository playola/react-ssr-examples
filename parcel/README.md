# Parcel React SSR

## Getting started

Clone the project and install dependencies:

```
  git clone https://github.com/playola/react-ssr-examples.git

  cd react-ssr-examples/parcel

  npm install
```

The first time, you will need to generate the `build` folder in two steps:

```
  npm run watch

  npm run start-server
```

See http://localhost:3000.

If you already have the build folder, you can run `npm start` and it will run
both scripts at once.
